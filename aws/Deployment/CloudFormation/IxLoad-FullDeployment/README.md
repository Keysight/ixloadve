  --template-body file://aws/Deployment/CloudFormation/IxLoad-FullDeployment/AWS-2-VTA-Demo-Use-Case.json
```

**This method is applicable for all templates that deploy from 2 up to 14 Virtual Test Appliances**

---

#### ðŸ§· Example #2: Deploying an Add-On Use Case Template with one IxLoad VE Client and two Virtual Test Appliance

This adds a the IxLoad VE Client and a Virtual Test Appliance to an existing infrastructure (e.g., VPC, subnets).

**Resources Created:**
